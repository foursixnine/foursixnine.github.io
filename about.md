I'm a self-taught engineer or a hacker, depending on the question you ask; I love to solve problems of different sorts, coach, mentor, and guide; with almost 20 years of experience in 2022, I'd like to offer the perspective, knowledge, and expertise to those who'd like to tap into it.

Working with [Humans Not Robots](https://humansnotrobots.net), I can help with the soft skills side of your career and interview preparation, including improvements to your CV, along with Quality Engineering, IT Career Guidance, and Leadership Coaching. Furthermore, I offer Mentorships and Coaching for neurodivergent people, especially for those who are part of the ADHD tribe and the Autistic Spectrum Disorder tribe, tribes I belong to.

During the day, I'm passionate about Quality Engineering, Software Development Lifecycle, Product Management, Open Source software, and communities.
