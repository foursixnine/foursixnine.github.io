This is another attempt on having a blog

# General idea

So I want to convert the lagom theme into a template that can be applied to a gh pages site
thanks to how it was created, this is partially done, but still there are things that need to be
done or improved.

One of the things that I want to have the most, is one of these fancy and nice night modes.

## Running the thing

(This is mainly a reminder for myself on how to do this...)

`jekyll serve --incremental --detach`

# Real motivation

Well, CSS has been always troublesome, and all these new technologies that are emerging, are very
exiting, and I want to somehow catch up with boostrap, scss, ruby, go, rust and stuff that is
mainstream nowdays.
